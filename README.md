# Flight Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict flight prices. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `Sastaticket_Flight_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `.csv`: containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- `models/`: Directory for saving trained models.
- `images/`: Directory for storing images and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of flight details such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, duration, total stops, and price. The data includes various features that affect flight pricing.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several key sections:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the dataset to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features that are most relevant for predicting flight prices.
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or advanced models like Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
